# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week felt like it was going great with my confidence from last week, but once thursday hit i realized that i don't really know what i am doing and now i have no idea how the checkpoint is going to go. using the mcv method definitely has been taking up more time to accomplish the same thing. i am hoping that i will get faster and have a better understanding quickly.

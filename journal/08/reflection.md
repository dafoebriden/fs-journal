# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was able to finish almost all of the back-end on my capstone and get a decent amount done on the front-end
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned a lot of different things that I didnt know before. I cant remember all of the things that ive learned since everything kinda just gets jumbled together in my head.
- What are you struggling with?
I find it very difficult to focus on one thing at a time when working with a larger application. whenever i learn something new i feel the need to implement it everywhere in my code and that i have to go fix all the code that i have already written all at once.
- What would you count as a victory?
I would count all the progress that i have made as a victory. I think that this capstone is going pretty well for the time that I have spent on it considering I am doing it all on my own.

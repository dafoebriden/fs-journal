# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > |we use git to upload repositories to store and/or show off our code, git is also used so multiple developers can work together without conflict.|

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > |make new directory|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > |a pseudo-class is used to define the state of an element. it is used in many different ways for example it can be added to classes to have a special effect. i dont know many pseudo-classes but i would say that i will mostly use pseudo-classes to add an active style to different elements or classes like a tags or buttons. i will probably use the hover pseudo-class quite a bit as well as active, visited, or the different child pseudo-class selectors.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > |as far as i am aware, specificity is the hierarchy of html. for example specificity will override any class or style that was set for the parent when it is added to a child. so far use specificity to target specific elements to change their class without having to change anything else.|

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | I think if this feature was used to much it could totally ruin the design of your project if you lose track of what is being overridden and you accidentally start overriding ccs rules that you didnt want to, especially when your css code starts getting long. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > |Selector{Property:Value}|

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | I think that even if there was a lot of time and effort put into the structure or functionality of a project/website, if the design is horrible then it will make it look like that was not the case. the visual aspect of anything is the first thing that anyone as a person will notice, and if the design is bad then we will automatically assume that there was not very much effort put in and that it is not important. This will make the project not very attractive or appealing|

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | to get a basic structure for your project that way you dont get lost when laying it out. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | I think that they can definatly be worth it and will become more and more helpful the more complicated your project become and the more boxes that it involves. i dont think that they take very much time and are a very good referance to have that way you dont get lost when structuring your html docs.|

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | This property automatically aligns all the direct content/children horisontally and allows you to lay them out in various ways without messing with any margin or padding.  |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | height, width, padding, margin,border.|

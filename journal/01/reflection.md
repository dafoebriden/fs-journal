### Answer
The difference between my last week of work and this first week of school is black and white. I went from a job that was 90% physical labor/muscle memory and 10% brain power where: I knew what I was doing, had a routine that i was used to, and a financial profit- TO - School that is 10% physical/(learning hahaðŸ¥²)muscle memory and 90% brain power where: I don't know anything, i'm starting a new routine, and i have lots of expenses with no income. If that doesn't give scope to how I am feeling this week then I don't know what will, I know my lower back can relate. It has been very intense how much information that has been sent into my brain this week. I have learned so much in this week alone, even though it feel like a constant battle to retain information. I think overall this week has gone well since I have been able to complete most of each lab and learn some new things along the way that were not taught in lecture. I think the biggest surprise for me this week is how fast time flies during the day(its almost like im enjoying it or somethingðŸ˜œ).One of my biggest struggles so far it trying to get manage my time and get everything done in a timely manner without getting black boxed. Because time goes so fast a lot of the times i get stuck i don't realize it until i solve the problem and notice that i spent way to much time on it. I think it somewhat easy for me to understand how things work in code, the hardest part is everything that needs to be memorized. I would count it a victory that i am now able to build a simple website using html and css, bootstrap. Overall i am very excited for what the rest of this course has to bring.

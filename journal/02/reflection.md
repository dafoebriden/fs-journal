# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



This week was a little hard. I am finding it hard to understand all of the functions for working with arrays, and the functions inside of functions. having my tutor session was very encouraging, but I am struggling to find the line between understanding the content and just copying our code references. i think the tutor session was kind of a victory because mick helped me realize that a lot of my struggles were self inflicted. I am really excited to get the hang of javascript though and am anxious for our checkpoint.

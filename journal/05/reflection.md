# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I liked how much review there was this week. I think it was a big deal for trying to catch up, I also think that the Schemas are not that complicated and fun to build.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I did not think that the front and back end would be some similar in structure. I also was not expecting for the backend to basically be what structures the api and stuff
- What are you struggling with?
Im struggling with most of the details that come with most of the backend framework. I understand the theory behind it all but I don't get what everything does and how each little thing contributes. It just seemed like almost everyone else in class was confident in working through building the bird sighting project but i was just trying to follow along the whole time, I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to contribute like everyone else.
- What would you count as a victory?
I would count monday as a victory. I passed my checkpoint with flying colors and felt like i kind of understood the lab that project and lab that we built that day.
